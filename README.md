# Demographics and their effect on income brackets
## Analyzing how different demographic characteristics affect whether a person in the workforce generates above or below $50,000 a year.

Taylor Brown

The main question is how to best predict if a person will generate lesser or greater than $50K a year by using the demographic information available to us.

### To prepare this data, the data was cleaned and the following processes were performed:

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

For exploratory purposes, two bar graphs were used to gain an understanding of the distribution of the dataset, putting most in administrative or specialty occupations and having mostly only a high school diploma.

Comparisons were also made between hours per week worked and gender in regards to income brackets which showed, for both genders, that the higher bracket correlates with a general increase from the standard 40-hour work week.

Other investigations yielded no strong correlations between the available numerical data.

#### Explanatory Data Analysis

In search of more explanation in the different relationships between data, two scatterplots were created to show slight trends in regards to occupation and education. Generally, completed higher education correlates with a stronger tie to the greater income bracket along with generally less hours per week.

#### Machine Learning using the following models:
Logistic Regression model
KNeighbors model
